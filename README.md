# Automated-Download-File-Manager--ADFM--for-Windows

## Overview

A simple file manager to clean up the downloads folder on your system. The program was made with the aim to declutter the downloads folder and thus making items easier to find.

Currently ADFM (Version 0.1) can automatically manage the following file types :

- Word Documents (.docx)
- Excel Spreadsheets (.xlsx, .csv, .xml, xltx)
- PDFs (.pdf)
- zip files (.zip)
- applications (.exe and .msi)

## Instructions

1 . Specify the file path (e.g. C:/users/.../Downloads), **WARNING: make sure to not add a forward slash ('/') at the end as the program does this anyway.**

Folders will automatically be created and files will be sorted by file type

Here is an example of what you should expect after the cleaning process takes place :

** Before **
![Before cleanse](C:/Users/Rizwan/Pictures/Screenshots/before)

** After ** 
![after cleanse](C:/Users/Rizwan/Pictures/Screenshots/after)
